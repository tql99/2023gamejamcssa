## Introduction:

Top down 2D trap adventure game. The path is filled with non-obvious traps with a glitch: they donâ€™t always activate. Whenever one does and the player dies and has to replay their path, one of such previously unactivated traps might suddenly do, adding another layer of suspense to the player. Player wins when they get to the end of the map, and is welcomed with a pleasant surprise.
